# angular2-blueprints

This is a collection of blueprints that can be used with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli). The most recent version they've been tested against is 1.0.0-beta.15. The blueprints found here are essentially the same as those in [the angular-cli repo](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/tree/master/packages/angular-cli/blueprints), just with tabs and double quotes instead of spaces and single quotes.

## Usage

Drop the `blueprints` directory into the root of your Angular project and use `ng generate` commands like normal.

## Warnings

* Overriding the built-in blueprints is not documented, so use at your own risk.
* Only the officially supported (as per the angular-cli readme) blueprints have been overridden here:
 * Component
 * Directive
 * Pipe
 * Service
 * Class
 * Interface
